# PDF Merger Script

This script is designed to merge a set of PDFs (`1.pdf`, `2.pdf`, ..., `N.pdf`) while skipping the first page of each PDF. The script is written in Python and is compatible with Arch Linux.

## Prerequisites

Before you can use the script, ensure that you have Python installed on your system. Additionally, you'll need the `PyPDF2` library, which can be installed via pip:

```bash
sudo pacman -S python-pip
pip install PyPDF2
```
